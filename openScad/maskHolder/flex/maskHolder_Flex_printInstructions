Print Temperature:
- As there is some gapping necessary I tried to keep the printing temperature as low as possible.
- Following settings lead to a decent result:
	- Filament: renkforce, Flexible Filament, Bestell-Nr.: 1528334, conrad.ch
	- Heat bed: 50°C
	- Nozzle
	  - first layer: 220°C
	  - above: 195°C
